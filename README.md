# Whack-A-Mole-in-DOS
>The machine problem is a game called Whack a Mole. It uses graphics implementation and ASM advanced topics such as the INT 21H, INT 16H and INT 10H functions which includes the different keyboard and video operations. The program itself is inspired from the game Whack a Mole which is an arcade game in which players use a mallet to hit moles, which appear at random, back into their holes. The program first displays the main menu of the game which gives the user three options namely play, help and exit. The only tool to operate the said program is with the use of the keyboard. To choose from the three options in the main menu, the arrow keys are to be used. Once the user presses the enter key, a selection will be made. In the play option, the Whack a Mole game will be implemented where in the user must use the numpad keys to operate the spawning of the mallet in its designated location. Once the game is started, a timer of 60 seconds will countdown before the game ends. The spawning of each mole is in random which is made possible by an algorithm included in the program. Each whacked mole increases the score which is displayed in the game. As time passes, the game eventually gets more difficult by increasing the number of moles being spawned. Once the timer runs out, the game will end and brings the user back to the main menu. In the help option, the program displays the instruction and mechanics of how to play the game. In the exit option, the program will be terminated.
